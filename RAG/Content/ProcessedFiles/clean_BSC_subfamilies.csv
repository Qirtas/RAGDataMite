Data Valuation Techniques,Financial Perspective,"Techniques, and its derived metrics and KPIs, that help to assess the worth of data assets.","Techniques, and its derived metrics and KPIs, that help to assess the worth of data assets. These techniques could be varied and thus their metrics and KPIs can be directly linked to them. Independently, they can help determine potential revenue-generating opportunities, calculate cost savings, define the relative value of data, and understand the economic impact of it. Given their relative impact, they can help to define KPIs and metrics for Data Monetization (next subcluster). Nevertheless, the following one focuses on pricing and economic benefits only (i.e. value ≠ price )."
