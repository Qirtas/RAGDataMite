It encompasses multiple facets that ensure the reliability, applicability, and validity of the information within the specific scientific domain. The accuracy of data or results is not only about correctness but also about their overall suitability for achieving the desired objectives in a given context.\nThe complexity of the relationship between accuracy and the value gained depends on the type of information and the organization. Moreover, unless specified, the basic calculation of value obtained by meeting the required accuracy. As defined by [12] Accuracy is depends on Range, Consistency, Typicality and Moderation Metrics. Nevertheless, different key elements can also be used to explain accuracy:\nPrecision: Refers to the granularity or level of detail in the data.

For example, reporting a temperature as 37.456°C instead of rounding to 37°C can be crucial in laboratory experiments.\nTimeliness: Information must reflect the most current state. In scientific research, outdated data can lead to incorrect conclusions, making the timeliness of updates or recalibrations essential.\nRelevance: Accuracy is context-dependent. Data must be both correct and directly applicable to the research question or hypothesis. For instance, accurate but irrelevant data adds no value to the scientific inquiry.\nCompleteness: Scientific accuracy requires that no critical data points are missing. Incomplete datasets can lead to skewed or biased results, undermining the validity of findings.\nTraceability: The provenance of data ensures it can be verified and validated. For science, traceability means being able to track data back to its source, such as instrumentation or observation records, to confirm its authenticity.\nTolerance and Range: Recognizes that minor inaccuracies or deviations may be acceptable within specified thresholds. Scientific accuracy involves defining these thresholds to minimize the impact on overall validity. Furthermore, in terms of range it specifies limits for acceptance too.\nContext Dependence: Accuracy must meet the specific standards and expectations of the scientific discipline. For example, a minor deviation in physics experiments might be acceptable, whereas in clinical trials, even small inaccuracies can have serious consequences.\nConsistency: Data should be reliable and uniform across various trials or applications. Inconsistencies in repeated experiments can signal issues with data accuracy.\nTypicality: Measures whether the data reflects typical or expected conditions.

Developed by Japan's Green IT Promotion Council, the Data Cetnre Perfromance per Energy metric combines four sub-metrics: Green Energy Consumption (GEC), Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), IT Equipment Energy Efficiency (ITEE), and IT Equipment Utilization (ITEU). It provides a holistic view of the energy efficiency of data centers, factoring in both facility and IT equipment performance. Similarly, Power to Performance Effectiveness (PPE) is a metric that evaluates the efficiency of energy consumption in relation to the performance output of IT equipment within a data center. Specifically, PPE measures how much power is consumed to achieve a certain level of performance. DCEP: This metric measures the productivity of a data center relative to the energy it consumes. It evaluates how much useful work (e.g., computational tasks, data processing) is accomplished per unit of energy consumed. Communication Network Energy Efficiency (CNEE) is a metric that evaluates the energy efficiency of a data center's communication network. It measures the amount of energy required to deliver a unit of data (usually a bit or byte) across the network within a data center. NPUE: This is a more specific metric that focuses on the energy consumed by the networking components of the data center. EPC: evaluates how well the energy consumption of individual devices or systems (such as servers, networking devices, or storage systems) scales with their workload. In an ideal scenario, a system with high EPC would use energy proportionally to its workload, consuming minimal energy when under low or no load."

Utility, "[\"Application Characteric Index\", \"Retention\"]", "[\"Data Valuation Techniques\"]", "Utility measures how effectively a dataset or system contributes to achieving strategic and operational goals, factoring in organizational use, data processes, quality, and constraints, and can be quantified through a structured utility function or scoring system reflecting its overall functional value.", "Utility, within the context of data valuation, refers to the effectiveness of a resource (e.g., datasets or systems) in achieving objectives. Unlike usability, which includes ease of interaction and other aspects, utility evaluates the functional contribution of the resource to possible outcomes. Furthermore, utility even though similar, is not the same as relevance. Relevance is linked to the specific use case and thus is connected to specific domains, while utility is more general.\nUtility, as specified in this work, could be represented mathematically as a continuous function U (i, j, k, l), where i denotes the organisational activities that could use the data, j represents the data/processes needed to generate information (e.g. if data is distributed and steps required to construct), k corresponds to the quality dimension (e.g., accuracy or timeliness), and l indicates the penalty terms (e.g. like costs and legal binding associated with the data). This formalization allows for the systematic evaluation of utility as a function of the resource's effectiveness in achieving strategic and operational objectives.\nThe general structure of relevance (to calculate the utility function is): \n\nRi,j,k,l = R(Organizational(i), Intrinsic(j), Quality(k); Penalty(l)). \n\nIf a process or activity does not influence a dataset or vice versa, the utility value is defined as U (i, j, k, l) = 0. To evaluate the total utility, you can aggregate the relevance. This aggregation is expressed as a KPI as: \n\nTotal Utility = Σ Σ Σ Σ wi × wj × wk × wl × R(i, j, k, l). \n\nas a metric, utility can be calculated using Kolmogorov statistics. The Kolmogorov statistic can be used to compute utility in scenarios where utility is defined as the retention of the functional value of data after transformations like obfuscation, anonymization, or other data modifications. This approach leverages the Kolmogorov statistic to quantify the similarity between the original and transformed (e.g., obfuscated) data distributions. \nFinally, Utility and Relevance of a dataset can be measured using expert knowledge based on scoring system focusing on the context of the information. In casethe scoring system is used, it could be transformed to be defined as a KPI."

Therefore it differs from accuracy. Validity in [9] is defined as the adherence of data values to specified criteria, ensuring that each data entry is logically sound and meets predefined conditions. This is typically done by applying specific rules to the dataset.
